<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Nathaniel Hormozi, a 22-year-old college student with a passion for coding. Currently, I'm balancing my time between 
  pursuing my degree and attending a coding bootcamp, where I'm diving deep into the world of programming. My main focuses right now 
  are mastering C++ and HTML as I work towards becoming a proficient web developer.</p>

<p>Coding isn't just a hobby for me; it's a genuine love. There's something incredibly satisfying about bringing ideas to life through 
   lines of code and seeing how they come together to create something functional and beautiful. I thrive on the challenges and the constant 
   learning that programming offers.</p>

<p>One of the things I enjoy most about coding is the collaborative aspect. I'm a natural team player and love bouncing ideas off others, 
   solving problems together, and learning from different perspectives. Meeting new people and building connections within the tech community 
   is something I actively seek out because I believe that great things happen when talented minds come together.</p>

<p>When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me exploring new coffee shops, hiking in nature, or getting lost on a long car ride to who
  knows where. I believe in living a balanced life where creativity, learning, and adventure all play a part.</p>

  <p>Let's connect and create something amazing together! Whether it's coding projects, networking opportunities, or just grabbing a cup of coffee,
     I'm always up for new experiences and collaborations.</p>
